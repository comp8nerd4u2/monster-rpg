Development on hold for a bit. Looking for contributors to collaborate. Project is developed in my spare time and mostly for fun,
but it gets boring being the only contributor sometimes. Will contribute here and there when spare time is abundant since 
designing complex algorithms that might not even work when tested is extremely taxing on the mind.
